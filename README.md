The current state of my final is functional in the sense that you can create an account, create, add, and delete lists and items of those lists, and logout. The data is all stored in Firebase and is unique to each user. The first and last name and email of each user is stored with their unique ID in Firebase. The core concept of the assignment is here, but it does fail to execute the way the website should, per the assignment details and rubric. I do wish that the functionality of what I currently have was presented in a cleaner way, but I have run out of time and brain power. I look forward to cleaning this up a bit and meeting with you early next week.
